Stopwatch web application with description of the html code 
⏱️ Project Title: Stopwatch Web Application | Task-02
🏢 Organization: ProDigy Infotech Internship
📌 Project Description:
This project is a part of Task-02 of the ProDigy Infotech Internship. The goal is to build an interactive and responsive Stopwatch Web Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users track time intervals with accuracy and includes features such as start, pause, reset, and lap time recording.

This stopwatch functions entirely on the front-end and demonstrates the power of basic web technologies when building real-time, interactive applications.

🌐 Technologies Used:
HTML5 – for structuring the UI

CSS3 – for layout and styling (including gradient effects)

JavaScript (Vanilla) – for functional logic and interactivity

✨ Features:
✅ Start Timer – begins the time counting

✅ Pause Timer – stops/resumes the timer without resetting

✅ Reset Timer – clears time and resets to zero

✅ Lap Time Recording – captures split/lap times with timestamps

✅ Simple Circular Gradient UI – modern half-circle design with gradient

✅ Responsive Design – adjusts to various screen sizes

🎨 UI & Design Highlights:
Circle with Gradient:

A visually appealing circular stopwatch interface with a blue or multi-tone gradient

Half-Circle Timer Bar (optional enhancement):

To represent elapsed time graphically

Interactive Buttons:

Clearly marked Start, Pause, Reset, and Lap buttons with hover effects

🧠 How It Works:
JavaScript uses setInterval() to update the time every 10 milliseconds.

Time is tracked in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

Lap times are stored in an array and displayed dynamically.

UI updates in real-time using DOM manipulation.⏱️ Project Title: Stopwatch Web Application | Task-02
